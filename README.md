# StaticWebApp
##  overview
--Static sites enable you to decouple your content repository and front-end interface, giving you greater flexibility in how your content is served.<br> 
--Cost-efficiency is another reason companies migrate to a static site because static files are lightweight and often faster and cheaper to serve.<br>

## uses
--Static websites are back! The days when businesses used to have moving characters all over their landing page to make it look interesting ...<br>
--As the static pages' contents don't change often, the user doesn't have to update the web page often in the name of a quality check or maintenance activity.
